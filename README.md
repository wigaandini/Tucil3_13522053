## General Information
Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams, or word golf) is a well-known word game enjoyed by all ages. The game was invented in 1877 by Lewis Carroll, a writer and mathematician. In the game, players are given two words: a starting word and an ending word. To win, they must find a chain of words linking the start and end words. Both words always have the same number of letters. Each consecutive word in the chain may differ by only one letter. The goal is to find the optimal solution, which minimizes the number of words included in the chain.
